The code looks pretty good, but improvements can definitely be made (and i've already made a few)

The build.xml could use a seperate target for the command-line interface, because they current setup has it using ant compile and then calling javac, which sucks
So I added that already.

I also already tackled a few of the issues, such as cleaning up the ui and adding dialog boxes for victory and failure states.

One idea that I had for the project that I want to implement is saving functionality, so that even if you quit the game you can come back and resume again
I would do this by saving the map as a text file and then encrypting it so that you couldn't cheat just by opening the file.

I might also add in pictures for flags and mines, instead of just using F's and X's

The possibilities are endless!
