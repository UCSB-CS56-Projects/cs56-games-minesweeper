# Kate Perkins and Ryan Wiener

1. A minesweeper game that has both a text and GUI interface


2. * As a text user I can run the text game so that it displays in the shell
   * As a GUI user I can run the game so that it displays in a window on my screen
   * As a GUI user I can choose a game difficulty so that the grid size and number of mines will change
   * As a GUI user I can read the leaderboards so that I can see my high scores


3. Yes the software runs allowing to play minesweeper in the shell or in a graphical window


4. * As a winner I can enter my name after the game is complete so that I can avoid doing it in the main menu
   * As a GUI user I can place actual images of flags so that I can avoid mines
   * As a text user I can experience a text game that refreshes itself in the shell so that it doesn't reprint after every move
   * As a GUI user I can enjoy a vivid color scheme so that I can enjoy my gaming experience to its full extent
   * As a first time user I can be prompted with a tutorial so that I know how to play


5. Everything seems good but those equal signs before titles makes it hard to read. Overall, the README is very detailed and clearly explains the application. We could add more information about the purpose of each class.


6. Add a target to build a jar file for the text and GUI versions of the game


7. Yes the issues are clear, but there are only 600 points worth of issues


8. * [Main menu layout](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-minesweeper/issues/49 "Issue #49")
   * [Leaderboard](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-minesweeper/issues/48 "Issue #48")
   * [isGui in Grid.java](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-minesweeper/issues/47 "Issue #47")
   * [GUIGame.java is pointless](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-minesweeper/issues/51 "Issue #51")


9. * Both test and regular class files are located in one folder. We'd like to separate them into separate folders so that they are easier to find. 
   * The GUIGame.java class isn't used. The GUI version uses MineGUI.java class and the text version uses TextGame.java. 
   * We noticed some variables that seemed unnecessary to the functionality of the application. 
       * In MineGUI.java, they use a variable size that simply assigned the size of the public Grid game. 
       * In Grid.java, there is a private boolean isGUI. We don't see the point.  
   * With the exception of GUIGame.java, the relationship between the classes make sense. 
   * The code is easy to read and understand
   * Grid.java is the games logic class. HelpScreen.java, MineComponent.java, and MineGUI.java classes are basically the classes that control the user interface of the GUI game. The TextGui.java class control the text game.


10. There are two test classes GUITest.java and GridTest.java. 
      * The GridTest.java class looks well tests and covers the important methods in Grid.java class. 
      * The GUITest.java class is very empty. It doesn't seem to have completely covered all methods. We will expand the GUITest.java class to cover all methods.
