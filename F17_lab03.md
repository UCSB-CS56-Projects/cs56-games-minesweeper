1. A minesweeper game that has both a text and GUI interface
2.
* As a CUI I can run the text game in the shell
* As a GUI I can run the game in a window on my screen
* As a user I can choose a game difficulty
* As a user I can read the leaderboards
3. Yes the software runs allowing to play minesweeper in the shell or in a graphical window
4.
* Asking for winner's name after game is complete rather than at the main menu
* Adding images to the GUI implementation of the game
* Refresh the grid in the terminal instead of reprinting it
* Improve the color scheme
* Prompt first-time users with instructions screen
5. Everything seems good but those equal signs before titles
6. Add a target to build a jar file for the text and GUI versions of the game
7. Yes the issues are clear, but there are only 600 points worth of issues
